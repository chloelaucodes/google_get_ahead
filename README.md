# Google Get Ahead
 This repository holds my solution to the Google Get Ahead EMEA 2020 Coding Challenges in Java

## Introduction
 This Code Challenge is as part of the Google Get Ahead EMEA 2020, an invite only summer virtual
  program for female software engineers and developers. 500 females are invited for this 8 week
   long program and to watch the video sessions, interview workshops and coding challenges.
  
## Repository
  This repository holds a source directory, which holds the coding challenge solutions. The
   6 coding challenge starts from Week 2 and involves a prompt and options to solve the question
    in either Java, Python or C++. The files for each week will be stored in their respective
     `Week <num>` folders.
     
## Style
  This repository follows Google Style Guide. 
  
## Testing
  The solutions of the coding challenges are submitted in the Mimir platform, which integrates
   testing from within, hence the lack of test suites in this repository. There might be more
    test suite built further on for testing usages in the future.
