## Introduction
 This Code Challenge is as part of the 
 [Google Get Ahead EMEA 2020](https://events.withgoogle.com/get-ahead-emea-2020/#content), an
  invite-only summer virtual program for female software engineers and developers. 500 females in
   the European, Middle Eastern and African zone are invited for this 8 week long program and for video
    sessions, interview workshops and coding challenges.
  
## Repository
  This repository holds a [source](./src) directory, which holds the coding challenge solutions. The
   6 coding challenge starts from Week 2 and involves a prompt and options to solve the question
    in either Java, Python or C++. The files for each week will be stored in their respective
     `Week <num>` folders. My solutions are all written in my preference language: Java.
     
## Style
   This repository follows
    [Google Code Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) in Java. 
    
## Current Repository Index
  This repository currently has 2 tasks completed:
  * Week 2: [Flattened Iterator](src/Week 2/FlattenedIterator.java)
  * Week 3: [Balanced Parentheses](src/Week 3/BalancedParentheses.java)
  * Week 4: [Tree](src/Week 4/Tree.java)
  
## Testing
  The solutions of the coding challenges are submitted in the [Mimir](https://www.mimirhq.com/)
   platform, which integrates testing from within. However, I have built
   [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) tests within the week's folder.
  * Week 2: [Flattened Iterator Test](src/Week%202/FlattenedIteratorTest.java)
  * Week 3: [Balanced Parentheses Test](src/Week%203/BalancedParenthesesTest.java)
  * Week 4: [Tree Longest Path Test](src/Week%204/TreeLongestPathTest.java)
